The Maslo Group heroes have risen up against the tyrannical leadership of The Authority, and the fight is currently at a stalemate. As more of the cities population join the rebels, Victor is loosing more and more control of his city. He has to end the war quickly!</p>\r\n<p>A few months ago, he sent out scouting parties to trade weapons with other powerful cities on Exosia, but what they found was so much better. On their journey, an incredible new energy source was discovered, something they've never seen before on the planet, and Victor is determined to make it into a weapon.</p>\r\n<p>Tonight we're at the Ironside Docks where the Wolfrum Combat ship is bringing home that secret cargo. The Authority is there to meet the delivery and unload it safely, ready for transport out of the city. Unfortunately, they're in the Iron Spikes territory and Mavros is not happy about this. He runs one of the largest and most dangerous crime syndicates in New Haven, and he's heard about the secret delivery. Wanting more power for himself, he plans to ambush the Volk and steal the shipment right from under Victor's nose! Will he be outmatched or can he secure this advantage for himself?</p>\r\n<p>The Maslo Group are also aware of the delivery and need to know what Victor is planning. They send their best drone pilot, Anastasia and her Bee drones to watch the events unfold and to gather intelligence. They cannot strike until they know what they're up against, and tonight they're going to see a brutal fight unfold.</p>\r\n<p>________________________________________________</p>\r\n<p>Vala the Cyber Tiger was first available on our Patreon channel in August 2021.
